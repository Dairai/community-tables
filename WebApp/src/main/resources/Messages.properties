  CommunityTable is an open source project organized by the Community Tables initiative. It is a technical expression of a much more essential human drive to support <em>neighbors helping neighbors</em>.<br/>\

  <strong>Far Vision:</strong> The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.
