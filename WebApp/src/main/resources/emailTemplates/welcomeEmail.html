<h1>Welcome to Community Table TN</h1>
<p>
    <strong>THANK YOU</strong> for wanting to connect with us. We are so happy to have this opportunity to tell you
    about Community Table
    of TN.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>WE SERVE</strong> primarily Elizabethton located in the Appalachian region of Northeast TN. My husband
    and I were not born
    in the mountains but we feel honored to call it our home for the past several years. We love the beauty in
    nature around us and we love our community. I see in the people who live here, many of the values that have
    fallen by the wayside in modern life. Values such as, simplicity, sacrifice, transparency, and faithfulness in
    the face of much hardship.
</p>

<p>
    As we serve, we learn. Early on, we realized that many people in the community prefer face to face contact and do
    not depend on technology or respond to flashy attempts to impress or entertain. Due to these factors and more,
    we feel the best way to reach people is through a low-key and hands on approach.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is always relationship building seated in love, compassion and truth.
</p>

<h2>Building Relationships in the Community Through:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bright Spot Baskets containing useful and cheerful items. Sometimes we simply target a certain street or apartment
        building and go door to door. Other times we know of specific families or individuals in need.
    </li>
    <li>
        We help people with small projects or repairs for their home.
    </li>
    <li>
        We hold regular meals and gatherings to bring people together.
    </li>
    <li>
        We make products to sell that will fund Community Table.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>QUICK FACTS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        22% of residents in Carter County live in poverty.
    </li>
    <li>
        Over half of the elderly (65+) in our community live on less than $14,000 per year.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We see around us all the circumstances that go with poverty-addiction, chronically poor health, physical and
    mental disabilities, low self-esteem, lack of purpose, and worst of all, lack of hope.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong> the best way to make a real impact on the community is to create an ongoing stable yet
        approachable
    presence, continue with relationship building efforts, and to eventually implement programs and opportunities
    that will facilitate the changes people want to make possible.
</p>
<p>
    Once again, thank you for reaching out to us. We will be back in touch as we have news to share that we think
    may be of interest to you.
</p>

<p>
    Blessings,<br>
