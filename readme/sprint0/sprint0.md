## Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity
We used the online tool [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com). After filling a PBI's Definition of Ready and discussing a few details, _only_ the development team estimated the relative size of that PBI (those wearing dual hats switched to their development hat). The high and low votes got a chance to share their reasoning. If a consensus was not reached, a second vote was taken. Convergence happened each time and the story points were recorded.

## Initial Product Backlog Order
Here are the first 10 product backlog items along with their key value propositions listed to indicate which features offer more value sooner for our stakeholders. _Note: this is a snapshot as of 31 OCT 2016 and should not be used for any live data needs._
