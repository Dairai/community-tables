# Sprint 2 (11/14-11/25)

## Forecast

We forecasted we could get **16 story points** done during this sprint. 

The forecast correlated to the second four stories from our [Initial Ordered Product Backlog](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#initial-product-backlog-order):

| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __Summary__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 'About' content | 2 pts | As site owner, I want a page that communicates the mission of Community Table and provides visitors with key information so that they can better understand our vision and know who to contact to get involved. |
| 2. | 'Vision' Page | 3 pts | As site owner, I want a page that communicates the vision of Community Table and provides visitors with information about the future plans and overarching goals of CT. |
| 3. | Admin portal | 8 pts | As an admin I want to log in to an administrative portal so that I can perform functions that should be restricted to admins. |
| 4. | Admin list Member emails | 3 pts | As site owner, I want to be able to communicate to members via the email list, so that I can keep them informed about Community Table. |

## Burndown

Our burndown is based on the completion of each user story's [Sprint Task Checklist](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint1/sprint1.md#acceptance-criteria-and-sprint-tasks) (shown above) which were decomposed from the PBIs committed to the sprint. The last item is always "Meets Definition of Done" ([ref](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)). 
Subsequently, our Definition of Done has a checklist item for "Acceptance criteria completed" which corresponds to the specific acceptance criteria of each user story (also shown above).
