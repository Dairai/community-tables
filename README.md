## Far Vision
Community helping one another. Community Table is a platform to facilitate, support, and encourage neighbors helping neighbors.

Community Table is where people get together to share life, stories, and smiles over food.

Community Table seeks to model what it means to be a good neighbor and inspire others to open their hearts and homes to neighbors in need.

Community Table focuses on the neighborhood as a domain of friendly companions.

## Goals <!-- TODO -->
Meal once a week possibly, at least every other week. Sharing, breaking of bread, fellowship. Bring encouragement to neighbors, they get discouraged, disconnected, keep a continuity between people. Meal at her home for low income; also offer seasonal (e.g. fall) baskets / boxes. Provide a bright spot, encouragement. Focused on the elderly, then maybe disabled, and single moms. There is elderly housing nearby.

Meals: customer initally will pay for
Boxes: food donations

Future would be a building, gardening, canning classes, 1-2 meals a week. Products that are generated

## Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity
We used the online tool [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com). After filling a PBI's Definition of Ready and discussing a few details, *only* the development team estimated the relative size of that PBI. The high and low votes got a chance to share their reasoning. If a consensus was not reached, a second vote was taken. Convergence happened each time and the story points were recorded.
