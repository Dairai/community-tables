# CommunityTable
An open source project organized by the Community Tables initiative. It is a technical expression of a much more essential human drive to support _neighbors helping neighbors._

## Far Vision
The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.

## Stakeholders (User Personas)
Persona template adapted from [orangebus](http://orangebus.co.uk/insights/the-power-of-proto-personas).

### Michelle (Site Owner)

* _Age:_ 47
* _Gender:_ female
* _Location:_ Elizabethton, TN
* _Technical Comfort:_ fair to good 
* _Job Title:_ Founder, Community Table TN

__Backstory__ _Tell us a bit about their responsibilities and interests._ Michelle is married, a mother of three grown sons, has an undergraduate degree in the social services field, has worked/volunteered in nonprofit organizations for 7 plus years and has developed a passion to help the underserved in her Appalachian community.

__Motivations__ _How have they found or heard about the website/service? Why would they be interested?_ She is interested because the organization does not have a web presence or an effective way to communicate the message and needs of Community Table TN.

__Goals__ _What do they want to get out of this service? What are they aiming to achieve?_ To bring awareness to the public and the community about the organization and to have a viable way to sell products online and to gain financial donors to build the organization.

__Barriers__ _What would annoy them as they use it?_ If the site is incomplete or hard to maneuver.

__Quote__ _We’ll know we’ve done a good job when this persona tells us:_ 

> This website really helped bring awareness to the needs of Community Table TN and is something that the organization can use for future growth as well.

### Ruby (Neighbor in Need)

* _Age:_ 77
* _Gender:_ female
* _Location:_ Elizabethton, TN
* _Technical Comfort:_ computer illiterate
* _Job Title:_ retired retail sales

__Backstory__ _Tell us a bit about their responsibilities and interests._ Ruby is retired now for many years and has become isolated, struggling with health issues as well as the challenges of living on a social security income. Ruby feels lost after losing two daughters to cancer and the remaining daughter lives in another state. Ruby enjoys reading and occasional outings with her granddaughter whenever circumstances afford.

__Motivations__ _How have they found or heard about the website/service? Why would they be interested?_ Ruby has heard about the services through neighborhood outreach attempts. She is interested due to the resources offered and the social interaction.

__Goals__ _What do they want to get out of this service? What are they aiming to achieve?_ Mostly the social connection and the feeling that someone cares for them and will stay in consistent contact.

__Barriers__ _What would stop them from visiting, choosing and using the website/service._ Distrust or it does not meet their needs. _What would annoy them as they use it?_ If the services are inconsistent or not taking their needs into consideration.

__Quote__ _We’ll know we’ve done a good job when this persona tells us:_ 

> The baskets and neighborhood meals have given me hope and something to look forward to on a regular basis. I feel connected and valued.

### Linda (Community Member)

* _Age:_ 50
* _Location:_ Elizabethton, TN
* _Technical Comfort:_ fair
* _Job Title:_ retired due to disability

__Backstory__ _Tell us a bit about their responsibilities and interests._ Linda became disabled 8 years ago due to a brain aneurysm that caused a series of strokes. She has some difficulty in using her right side, but is determined to not be an invalid. Due to her medical conditions she cannot drive but she still enjoys some crafts and sewing. She is eager to help assemble baskets.

__Motivations__ _How have they found or heard about the website/service? Why would they be interested?_ Linda is interested because she still wants to be involved in activities in the community that are meaningful.

__Goals__ _What do they want to get out of this service? What are they aiming to achieve?_ A sense of purpose, a way to stay connected to others even after early retirement due to disability.

__Barriers__ _What would stop them from visiting, choosing and using the website/service._ If it is too complicated or unclear. _What would annoy them as they use it?_ Not having the resources provided to do the volunteer work effectively or if there are too many changes or cancellations by Community Table.

__Quote__ _We’ll know we’ve done a good job when this persona tells us:_ 

> I have something to look forward to each week because of the volunteer work I am doing through Community Table TN.

## Product Backlog
Community Tables current product backlog is available to development team members and management at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/i9TmhPfB/final-project-community-table)

## Definition of Ready
- Title
- User story opening sentence
- Additional details
- Story point estimation
- Acceptance criteria
- Architecture

## Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity
We used the online tool [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com). After filling a PBI's Definition of Ready and discussing a few details, _only_ the development team estimated the relative size of that PBI (those wearing dual hats switched to their development hat). The high and low votes got a chance to share their reasoning. If a consensus was not reached, a second vote was taken. Convergence happened each time and the story points were recorded.

## Rationale for Backlog Order
The backlog is ordered by value generated to our stakeholders, namely Community Table TN (the first customer for our open source products). We (as well as our key stakeholder) are starting from scratch (with the help of other open source software). Here are the first 10 product backlog items along with their key value propositions listed to indicate which features offer more value sooner. These pbis have been groomed to represent excellent users stories within our team Definition of Ready and have been estimated by the development team. This is our first product increment. _Note: this is a snapshot as of 31 OCT 2016 and should not be used for any live data needs._
