## Far Vision
The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.

## Goals <!-- TODO -->
Meal once a week possibly, at least every other week. Sharing, breaking of bread, fellowship. Bring encouragement to neighbors, they get discouraged, disconnected, keep a continuity between people. Meal at her home for low income; also offer seasonal (e.g. fall) baskets / boxes. Provide a bright spot, encouragement. Focused on the elderly, then maybe disabled, and single moms. There is elderly housing nearby.

Meals: customer initally will pay for
Boxes: food donations

Future would be a building, gardening, canning classes, 1-2 meals a week. Products that are generated

## Near Vision
To allow community members to sign up for an email list to receive updates about Community Table initiatives.

## Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity
We used the online tool [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com). After filling a PBI's Definition of Ready and discussing a few details, *only* the development team estimated the relative size of that PBI. The high and low votes got a chance to share their reasoning. If a consensus was not reached, a second vote was taken. Convergence happened each time and the story points were recorded.
