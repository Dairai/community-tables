## Far Vision
The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.

## Goals <!-- TODO -->
Meal once a week possibly, at least every other week. Sharing, breaking of bread, fellowship. Bring encouragement to neighbors, they get discouraged, disconnected, keep a continuity between people. Meal at her home for low income; also offer seasonal (e.g. fall) baskets / boxes. Provide a bright spot, encouragement. Focused on the elderly, then maybe disabled, and single moms. There is elderly housing nearby.

Meals: customer initally will pay for
Boxes: food donations

Future would be a building, gardening, canning classes, 1-2 meals a week. Products that are generated

## Near Vision
To allow community members to sign up for an email list to receive updates about Community Table initiatives.

1. Head Organizer of Community Table - Michelle (Real Person)

__Backstory__ _Tell us a bit about their responsibilities and interests._ Michelle is married, a mother of three grown sons, has an undergraduate degree in the social services field, has worked/volunteered in nonprofit organizations for 7 plus years and has developed a passion to help the underserved in her Appalachian community.

__Motivations__ _How have they found or heard about the website/service? Why would they be interested?_ She is interested because the organization does not have a web presence or an effective way to communicate the message and needs of Community Table.

__Goals__ _What do they want to get out of this service? What are they aiming to achieve?_ To bring awareness to the public and the community about the organization and to have a viable way to sell products online and to gain financial donors to build the organization.

__Quote__ _We’ll know we’ve done a good job when this persona tells us:_

Ruby feels lost after losing two daughters to cancer and the remaining daughter lives in another state. Ruby enjoys reading and occasional outings with her granddaughter whenever circumstances afford.

__Motivations__ _How have they found or heard about the website/service? Why would they be interested?_ Ruby has heard about the services through neighborhood outreach attempts. She is interested due to the resources offered and the social interaction.

## Product Backlog
[Community Table on Trello](https://trello.com/b/i9TmhPfB/final-project-community-table)

## Rationale for Backlog Order <!-- TODO -->


## Definition of Ready
- Title
- User story opening sentence
- Additional details
- Story point estimation
- Acceptance criteria
- Architecture

## Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity
We used the online tool [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com). After filling a PBI's Definition of Ready and discussing a few details, *only* the development team estimated the relative size of that PBI. The high and low votes got a chance to share their reasoning. If a consensus was not reached, a second vote was taken. Convergence happened each time and the story points were recorded.
